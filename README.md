# BallerRunnersApp
This is the first application I have created in Unity.
I utilized C# to develop the application. 
Objective: The object of the infinite runner game is to allow the character to run as far as it can by ducking, jumping, and moving left and right to evade randomly spawned obstacles and obtain power-ups.
